Dependencies:
	- MySQL Ver 9.5.0

Setup:
	This should be done in a linux terminal. With Windows
	machines, WSL works. With MacOS machines, you'll need the
	"brew" equivalent to the "sudo" commands.
	Run the following commands:
		sudo apt update
		sudo apt install mysql-server
		sudo service mysql start

---Phase 1---
Step 1:
	Save the "CompanyData.xlsx" file as a CompanyData.csv. This
	can be done through most sheet editors (like Excel).

Step 2:
	Run the provided "dataCleaner.py" script. This will produce
	the "CompanyDataCleaned.csv" file.

Step 3:
	Ensure mysql is running with:
		sudo service mysql status
	Then enter the MySQL shell with the following command:
		sudo mysql --local-infile=1 -u root -p
	This will enable local file copying (the .csv)

Step 4:
	Run the following command to finish enabling local file
	copying:
		SET GLOBAL local_infile = 1;

Step 5:
	Create the database with:
		CREATE DATABASE OGDataBase;
	Then use it with:
		USE OGDataBase;

Step 6:
	To create and populate the table, copy and run the commands
	in "OGDataTableCreator.sql".
	
	Note that the LOAD DATA INFILE command requires you replace
	"<LOCAL-PATH-HERE>" with your local path to the project's
	folder.

Step 7:
	To finish up, in a separate shell (outside of the MySQL
	shell) run:
		sudo mysqldump -u root -p OGDataBase OGDataTable > DataTableAfterPart1.sql

---Phase 2---
Step 1:
	In the MySQL shell, copy and paste the commands in
	"NormalizedTablesCreator.sql".
	This will create many tables that normalize the DB.

Step 2:
	To finish up, in a separate shell (outside of the MySQL
	shell) run:
		sudo mysqldump -u root -p OGDataBase OGDataTable orderProducts orders customers employees products suppliers categories quantities > DataTablesAfterPart2.sql
	
---Phase 3---
This phase is just an ER diagram. We have created one using
draw.io. Both the .drawio and the .pdf versions should be
available in the repository.

---Phase 4---
Step 1:
	In the MySQL shell, copy and pase the commands in
	"TableModifications.sql".
	This will modify the tables as per the ERD.

Step 4:
	To finish up, in a separate shell (outside of the MySQL
	shell) run:
		sudo mysqldump -u root -p OGDataBase OGDataTable orderProducts orders customers employees products suppliers categories quantities > DataTablesAfterPart4.sql
	
---Phase 5---
Step 1:
	In the MySQL shell, copy and paste the commands in
	"ViewCreator.sql".
	This will create the requested view.

Step 2:
	In the MySQL shell, copy and paste the commands in
	"SaleTrigger.sql".
	This will create the requested trigger.

Step 3:
	In the MySQL shell, copy and paste the commands in
	"RestockProcedure.sql".
	This will create the requested procedure.

---Phase 6---
Step 1:
	In the MySQL shell, copy and paste the commands in 
	"phase6.sql".
	This will create the two requested users.
Step 2: 
	Apply the privilege changes:
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Step 3:
	Verify privileges for each user:
	SHOW GRANTS FOR 'AlexSmith'@'localhost';
    SHOW GRANTS FOR 'JamieLee'@'localhost';
